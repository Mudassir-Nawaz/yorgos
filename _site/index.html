<p>I provide businesses with three core professional services: utilizing data to shape strategic choices and acquire customers, overseeing and ensuring the quality of services procured from external vendors, and crafting resilient data infrastructures capable of scaling alongside business growth.</p>

  <li>
    <p>While working at Northwestern University’s <a href="(https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2017/july/spiegel-research-center-recognized-for-marketing-education/)">Spiegel Research Center</a>, I collaborated with <a href="(https://www.powerreviews.com/)">Power Reviews</a>, a review platform provider, to investigate the correlation between customer reviews and purchasing behavior. This partnership yielded a <a href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~gar627/powerreviews.pdf">collection</a> of insightful and marketable <a href="(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pbd8qT7RDs2COvAZNgZg_mTZuJsTB0TB/view)">white papers</a>. Through meticulous analysis of extensive datasets, these papers showcased that the presence of reliable reviews significantly boosts sales and revenue for Power Reviews’s clientele.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teamed up with a Nashville-based healthcare logistics firm specializing in surgery staffing services to assess their impact on hospital productivity and surgeon satisfaction. The result was an enlightening white paper illustrating, through thorough analysis, the beneficial outcomes that arise when hospitals engage their services. Notably, their provider productivity exceeded our nationwide average estimates by 2X, while also fostering surgeon retention and improved patient outcomes through collaborative work with a trusted team of providers.</p>

<p><em>Have an expert in your corner to manage, test and configure the solutions you acquire from vendors.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>For a Nashville-based Porta Potty rental company, I reviewed the data the offerings of one of their service providers. I facilitated effective communication in both directions, comprehending mathematical and algorithmic modeling alongside provider data. This led to delivering well-defined suggestions on optimal service utilization, highlighting aspects where the off-the-shelf solution might not align perfectly. Additionally, I joined forces with the client to develop a tailored solution that layered atop the provider’s offering, finely tailored to the client’s unique requirements.</li>

<ul>
  <li>For a Nashville-based Porta Potty rental company, I provided insights and guidance throughout the development of their data architecture. This included the inception of the entity relationship diagram (ERD), the creation of intermediate tables, and their eventual utilization for dashboarding, reporting, and analytical needs.</li>

<h2 id="academic-and-professional-overview">Academic and Professional Overview</h2>
<p>My undergrad is in Mathematics from the University of Athens, Greece, and  I hold a <strong>PhD in Computer Science from Northwestern University</strong>, Evanston, IL. My PhD research focused on the <a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/852c4109961853cc539e34470217a915/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750">dynamics of online review platforms</a> (such as Amazon, Yelp and the Apple AppStore), blending mathematical modeling with real-world experiments and large scale data analysis.</p>

<p>My work has been featured in a variety of outlets, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/business/online-reviews-fake.html">The New York Times</a>.</p>

<p>After grad school, I was a part of the <strong>Spotify Notifications team for two years, collaborating with User Research, Product, and Engineering to enhance user engagement through timely and valuable notifications</strong>. After that, I was part of Spotify’s Finance team for a year, playing a key role in <strong>developing the user growth forecast</strong>. This forecast informed resource allocation decisions by the CFO as well as the quarterly shareholder guidance. I presented the math and engineering behind this work at the <a href="youtube.com/watch?v=tkmWXM0egqg">Rev2 Data Science conference in NYC</a>.</p>

<p>During my three years at <strong>Instagram, I spearheaded user growth by driving the redesign of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Web interface</a>, and strategically launching features like Messaging and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/instagram-post-from-desktop/">Post Creation</a> on Desktop</strong>. I wrote a blog post about the engineering and data work that went into <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/07/26/web/launching-instagram-messaging-on-desktop/">Launching Messaging on Desktop</a></p>

<p>My academic background and industry expertise converge to offer strategic insights and actionable solutions. I’m eager to explore how I can elevate your business.</p>
